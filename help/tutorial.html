<p>This tutorial provides a gentle, step-by-step introduction to programming with MiniScript.  If you've never programmed before, or just want a bit of guidance as you learn your way around a new language, you've come to the right place.</p>

<p>You should see two big boxes above: the first one is a code editor, and the second one (with the black background) is the output area.  (If you're on a desktop or laptop, and these don't appear side-by-side, try stretching the browser window out until they do.)</p>

<p>Click in the code editor, and you should get a blinking cursor.  Select all the text in there, delete it, and then type the following.</p>

<pre class="code">print 123</pre>

<p>Now click the <b>Run</b> button.  You should see the number <span class="code">123</span> appear in the output area.</p>

<p>If you got an error, don't worry!  Just check your typing very carefully.  Computers are picky about spelling, spacing, and capitalization.  Everything must be exactly as shown.</p>

<p><b>Congratulations!</b>  You have written your first MiniScript program!  It's not a very <i>interesting</i> program, but we'll fix that very soon.</p>
