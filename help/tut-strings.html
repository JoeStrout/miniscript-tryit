<p>In addition to <a href="#" onclick="help_select('tut-nums'); return false;">numbers</a>, MiniScript can also work with letters and any other printable characters.  In computer jargon, a group of characters is called a "string" because they are strung together in a fixed order.  Try this:</p>

<pre class="code">print "Hello world!"</pre>

<p>Run this program.  You should see the words <span class="code">Hello world!</span> appear in the output area.  Again, if you get an error, check your spelling and punctuation very carefully and try again.</p>

<p>That <span class="code">"Hello world!"</span>part of the code is a string.  Strings in MiniScript must always begin and end with <b>quotation marks</b> &mdash; exactly the straight, double-type quotation marks shown; single-quotes or curly quotes won't work.</p>

<p>Between the quotation marks, you can type almost anything.  Perhaps you're programming an old-school cartoon character who curses like this:</p>

<pre class="code">print "@*#&!"</pre>

<p>But what if you want to print a quotation mark?  There's a special trick for that.  Within a string, you must type the quotation mark <i>twice</i>.  MiniScript will see that and interpret it as just one quotation mark.  Try it:</p>

<pre class="code">print "This --> "" <-- is a quotation mark!"</pre>

<p><b>Challenge:</b> Can you get MiniScript to print the following output?

<pre>Hello, "Bob," if that is your real name.</pre>

<p>Give it a try!</p>
