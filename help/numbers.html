<p>Numbers in miniscript are always stored in full-precision format (like the <i>double</i> type in C and C#).  In other words, they can represent both whole numbers and decimals.  The following are all valid MiniScript numbers:<p>

<pre class="code">42
-5
3.14157</pre>

<p>They also represent true (1) and false (0), as well as degrees of truth in between (see <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a>).  The built-in keywords <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> are equivalent to 1 and 0, respectively.</p>

<p>Numbers support the following operators:</p>

<table class="oplist">
<tr><th>+, -, *, /</th><td>add, subtract, multiply, divide</td></tr>
<tr><th>%</th><td>mod (remainder)</td></tr>
<tr><th>^</th><td>power</td></tr>
<tr><th>and, or, not</th><td>logical operators</td>
<tr><th>==, !=, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=</th><td>comparison</td>
</table>
