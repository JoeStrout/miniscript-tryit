<p>In your <a href="#" onclick="help_select('tutorial'); return false;">first MiniScript program</a>, you printed the number 123 to the output.</p>

<p>You could print any number here, including ones with decimal points.  Try this:</p>

<pre class="code">print 2.71828</pre>

<p>But that's not all.  MiniScript can also do math, using <b>+</b> for addition, <b>-</b> for subtraction, <b>*</b> for multiplication, and <b>/</b> for division.  Try it!</b>

<pre class="code">print 6 * 7</pre>

<p>Note that MiniScript is <i>not</i> picky about spaces around such operators.  Try changing "6 * 7" to "6*7" or even "6* 7" or any other variation.  You should find they all produce the same result.</p>

<p>Ready for your first multi-line program?  People often say 22/7 (22 divided by 7) is a decent approximation of pi.  But how good is it?  Let's find out, using the fact that <span class="code">pi</span> is a built-in function in MiniScript.</p>

<pre class="code">print 22/7
print pi
print 22/7 - pi</pre>

<p>You should have three lines of output.  The first is the value of 22/7, approximated as a decimal.  The second line is the value of pi (both to six decimal places).  And the last line is the difference between them.</p>

<p>There are a few other <a href="#" onclick="help_select('numbers', ['tut-nums', 'Tutorial']); return false;">operators</a> and <a href="#" onclick="help_select('numeric-funcs', ['tut-nums', 'Tutorial']); return false;">functions</a> that work with numbers.  But you don't need to worry about those for now.  Let's move on!</p>
