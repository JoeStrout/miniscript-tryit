<p>An <b>if statement</b> can be extended with an <b>else clause</b> to specify what should be done when the given condition is <i>not</i> true.  Here's an example:

<pre class="code">age = val(input("Enter your age:"))
if age > 23 then
   print "Wow, you're old!"
else
   print "Hello, youngster!"
end if</pre>

<p>This program asks the user to enter their age.  If they enter a number greater than 23, it prints "Wow, you're old!"  Otherwise &mdash; if they do <i>not</i> enter a number greater than 23 &mdash; then it prints "Hello, youngster!"  It can never print both; it will always print either one or the other.</p>
