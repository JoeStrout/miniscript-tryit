<p>"Looping" in programming means executing a set of statements more than once.  The computer does them once, then it loops back up and does 'em again.  MiniScript has exactly two ways to loop:</p>

<p>The <b>for ... in</b> statement loops over a block of code once for each value in some list of values.  This is also the easiest way to execute a block a certain number of times.</p>

<p>The <b>while</b> statement loops over a block of code as long as some condition is true.</p>
