<p>Use a <b>while</b> loop to repeat a block of code as long as some condition is true.</p>

<pre class="code">s = "Spam"
while s.len < 50
   s = s + ", spam"
end while
print s + " and spam!"</pre>

<p>This loop keeps adding to a string as long as the length is less than 50.</p>

<p>If you need to make a "forever" loop that never exits, use <b>while true</b>.  (See the <b>break</b> topic for an example.)</p>
