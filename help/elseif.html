<p>Sometimes you want to check for one condition, and if that fails, then you want to check for something else.  Maybe there's a bunch of different cases you want to check for!  The <b>else if</b> clause does exactly that.</p>

<pre class="code">age = val(input("Enter your age:"))
if age > 50 then
   print "Grant me your wisdom, O elder!"
else if age > 23 then
   print "Wow, you're old!"
else if age < 1 then
   print "Frankly, I don't believe you."
else
   print "Hello, youngster!"
end if</pre>

<p>An <b>if/else-if/else</b> construct like this checks each condition, in order, executing the block that matches first, and then jumping to <b>end if</b>.  If none of the conditions match, the optional <b>else</b> clause will be executed.</p>
