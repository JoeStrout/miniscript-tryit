<h2>Welcome to MiniScript!</h2>

<p><b>MiniScript</b> is a simple, clear programming language designed to be embedded in other programs, or used as a teaching tool.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">DON'T PANIC!</font></b>  MiniScript is very easy to learn.  In fact this <a target="quickref" href="http://miniscript.org/files/MiniScript-QuickRef.pdf">Quick Reference</a> tells you everything you really need to know about MiniScript in a single page.</p>

<p>If you are a language lawyer or just really love getting into the details, the <a target="manual" href="https://miniscript.org/files/MiniScript-Manual.pdf">MiniScript Manual</a> has it all.</p>

<p>But you'll do just fine poking around in the list of topics at left, and experimenting.  Don't be afraid to try stuff; you can't hurt anything!  Programming is fun, and programming in MiniScript is <i>especially</i> fun.</p>
