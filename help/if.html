<p>The <b>if statement</b> is how your code makes decisions in MiniScript.  It simply defines a block of statements to execute when a given condition is true.  It looks like this:</p>

<pre class="code">if 2+2 == 4 then
   print "math works!"
end if</pre>

<p>This says that if two plus two is equal to four, then it should print "math works!"; otherwise, it should not (because in that case, math would be very broken!).</p>

<p>Notice that, unlike some programming languages, you do not need parentheses around the condition in an <b>if</b> statement (and using them is considered bad style).</p>

<p>You can have any number of statements inside the <b>if</b> block.  And of course, if statements can be nested.  When the condition is not true, MiniScript will skip down to the corresponding <b>end if</b>.
